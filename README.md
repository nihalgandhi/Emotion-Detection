# Emotion-Detection
Emotion recognition using facial recognition is a major area of interest within various fields. This report reviews the implementation of different aspects, such as image pre-processing, feature extraction by using various methods like SVD, and emotion recognition. Different emotional theories and defining methods for studying a variety of facial images in databases as well as detecting and extracting emotions are studied. The purpose of this report is also to identify and extensively study the framework and components related to image processing as well as emotion recognition. This will also help us to establish the significance of the general fields of image processing and emotion recognition and thus help to contribute to the already existing emotion recognition technologies.
